# Simple Portfolio

:gem: A very simple portfolio page made with CRA.

**Demo:** You can check it out from: https://cakebatterandsprinkles.github.io/portfolio-react

**Note:** The links might not all work, as this was my old portfolio (the first one I made for myself after I graduated from the bootcamp) and I have changed it deleted some of these projects. Either way, I still like the layout and the simplicity of it, so I decided to keep the portfolio itself, even though the projects inside are probably not alive.

:honeybee: Thanks for checking it out!
